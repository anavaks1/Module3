# Module 3 Labs

Welcome to Module 3 Labs. This lab is designed to practice the JavaScript skills through a series of unit tests and exercises.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you through the setup and execution of the lab exercises.

### Task 1: Pass All Unit Tests

To pass all the unit tests in the current repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**
   Use `git clone https://github.com/dasingh9/module3-lab.git` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install packages**
   Navigate to the cloned directory and run `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.

3. **Write implementation code**
   Open the file `test/lab3.test.js` and write the implementation code necessary to pass all the unit tests. You can look for relevant comments/placeholders in `test/lab3.test.js` to see where you need to write your code.

4. **Test your code**
   Execute `npm test` to run the unit tests and verify that your implementation code passes all tests. Try running `npm test` repeatedly every time you complete impementation for a test case.

### Task 2: Complete the Intermediate Lab Exercises

Download and refer to the `JSIntermediate_LabExercises.pdf` document in this repository to complete the intermediate lab exercises.

### Task 3: (Optional) Complete the Fundamentals Lab Exercises

For additional practice, you can refer to the `JSFundamentals_LabExercises.pdf` document to complete the fundamental lab exercises. This is optional but recommended for a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript basics.
